# Setup Your CodeSpace Environment

## Create the CodeSpaces environment

On the main page of your forked version of this repo, go to: **Code** -> **Codespaces** tab -> **Create codespace on main**.

> [!NOTE]
> This step will automatically open a new browser explorer tab with an online version of Visual Studio Code. This will be your CodeSpaces environment.

### How to run the labs/code?

* The demos are provided as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files).
* **To run the Jupyter Notebook**, inside Github Codespaces Visual Studio Code, select the demo inside the **labs** folder, then click **Select Kernel** (at top right of the jupyter notebook) and select the default **Python 3.12.1** option shown.
* You can now **Run** each action (piece of code) or **Run All** to execute the whole notebook.
